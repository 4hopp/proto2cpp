= Idea behind proto2cpp

Open Simulation Interface uses Doxygen to generate its reference documentation.
OSI provides a Doxygen filter for generating its reference documentation from .proto files.
This Doxygen filter is based on a similar filter by https://sourceforge.net/p/proto2cpp/wiki/Home/[Timo Marjoniemi].

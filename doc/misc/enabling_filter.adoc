= Enabling the Doxygen filter for Google Protocol Buffers .proto files

You have to create an appropriate Doxygen configuration file to use Doxygen with .proto files.

**Prerequisites**

You have installed _Doxygen_.

**Steps**

. Open a command line interpreter.
. Generate a Doxygen configuration file.
+
[source]
----
 doxygen -g <filename>
----
+
. In the Doxygen configuration file, find `FILE_PATTERNS` and add `*.proto`:
+
[source]
----
FILE_PATTERNS = *.proto
----
+
. In the Doxygen configuration file, find `EXTENSION_MAPPING` and add `proto=C++`: 
+
[source]
----
EXTENSION_MAPPING = proto=C++
----
+
. In the Doxygen configuration file, find `INPUT_FILTER` and add this script: 
+
[source]
----
INPUT_FILTER = “python proto2cpp.py”
----

**What to do next**

Run Doxygen with the modified configuration file.

//TODO: Can't we just omit the following information? If it is not necessary, and does not add anything useful, then there is no reason to include it.

//Following change is recommended by Timo Marjoniemi but must not be used: In the Doxygen configuration file, find JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF and set it enabled: JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF = YES

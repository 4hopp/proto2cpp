--------------------
 0.4-beta (2013-08-29)
  - 'classified' proto2cpp and updated documentation to make the
     script itself Doxygen compatible
  - changed all print statements to print() functions
     * 64-bit Python v3.3.1 running on 64-bit Windows Home Premium
       did not automatically convert print statements to print()
       functions but instead raised a syntax error
  - made a change so that .proto files are converted before printing
    and other files are printed to stdout as is
     * this allows using the filter with multiple file types
--------------------
 0.5-beta (2014-11-16)
  - fixed enum ending to have semicolon to have proper enum syntax
    in struct (thanks to m47iast for pointing this out)
